          We just released windUI v1.5, which includes a brand new component. An activity feed is a chronological record of system events or user actions. Have a look at the feed page and let me know what you think. Feedback is highly appreciated.

        It looks awesome! Good one! The only thing that I would tweak is the spacing in smaller screens. Other than that it looks superb! Really loved the color as well.

        Love it! I really like how the nested feeds are working as well. Is that going to be multi-nested? Or maybe stay in just one level. Also any ides on how I can remove the time stamp from the feeds?        </p>
